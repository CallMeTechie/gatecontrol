### Fixes
- wg0 FORWARD accept all tunnel traffic, not just VPN subnet

---

## [1.20.7] — 2026-04-09

### Fixes
- wg0 FORWARD rule must be a catch-all `-i wg0 -j ACCEPT`, not scoped to
  `-d ${GC_WG_SUBNET}`. The narrow scope only permitted peer-to-peer and
  silently dropped every VPN → internet packet (FORWARD policy DROP),
  so the tunnel came up but clients had no external connectivity. The
  reply path stays covered by the existing RELATED,ESTABLISHED rule.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-29

### Features
- **Client Scope for API Tokens** — New dedicated `client` scope restricts tokens to `/api/v1/client/*` endpoints only. Windows/Desktop clients no longer need the overly broad `peers` scope.
- **Token Permissions UI Restructured** — Scopes are now grouped into three sections: Access Level, Resources, and Integration. Full-access acts as a master toggle that auto-selects and disables all other checkboxes — no more manually checking every option.

### Tests
- **Token Scope Tests** — New `tests/tokens.test.js` with 33 tests covering scope validation, `checkScope` logic (full-access, read-only, client, resource scopes, edge cases), token CRUD API, and token-based auth enforcement.

---

## [1.5.2] — 2026-03-24

### Improvements
- **Multiple Backends — Peer Selection** — Backend targets now use a peer dropdown instead of manual IP input. Peer IPs are resolved at Caddy config build time, so backend configs automatically update when a peer's IP changes. Disabled peers are skipped.
- **Mirror Targets — Peer Selection** — Same improvement for Request Mirroring targets. Peer dropdown instead of IP input, automatic IP resolution, disabled peers skipped.

### UI
- Dashboard stat cards: 5 columns layout, compact padding and font sizes
- Dashboard: Fixed missing green stripe on Monitoring card
- Sidebar: Peer badge now consistently shows total peer count (was showing online count on dashboard, total on other pages)
- Sidebar: Removed peer group count badge (redundant)

### Documentation
- `documentation/USER-GUIDE.md` — Complete user guide covering DNS setup, peer/client configuration, WireGuard clients (including docker-wireguard-go), all route features, authentication methods, 2FA/TOTP setup
- `demo/index.html` — Interactive animated demo with pixel-accurate GateControl UI, 2 walkthrough scenes (Peer creation with QR code, Route creation with all feature toggles), auto-scrolling cursor

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-03-23

### Security — Critical
- **CSRF-Bypass Prevention** — Defensive reset of `req.tokenAuth` against prototype pollution attacks
- **Route-Auth Forward-Auth** — Returns 401 instead of 200 when `x-route-domain` header is missing
- **Caddy Config Injection** — Header name/value validation, rate_limit_window allowlist, sticky_cookie_name regex
- **DNS-Check SSRF** — Domain validation before DNS lookup, resolved IPs removed from response
- **Key-File Permissions** — Re-secured after recursive chown in entrypoint

### Security — High
- **Route-Auth Lockout** — Changed from IP-based to email-based lockout (prevents IP rotation bypass)
- **OTP Range** — Full 000000–999999 range with `padStart` (was excluding leading-zero codes)
- **OTP Resend** — Requires valid pending 2FA session before allowing code resend
- **CSRF Key Separation** — Route-auth CSRF uses HMAC-derived key instead of shared app secret
- **WireGuard Config Injection** — DNS validated as IP list, keepalive as integer, newlines blocked
- **Email HTML Injection** — All interpolated values in email templates escaped
- **Route Target SSRF** — Private/loopback IPs blocked for direct route targets (peer-linked routes unaffected)
- **Metrics Token Leak** — Removed `?token=` query parameter auth, header-only authentication
- **WG Key in Logs** — wg-quick output filtered to strip private key lines
- **Trust Proxy** — Restricted to loopback only (prevents IP spoofing via X-Forwarded-For)
- **CSP Styles** — Split into `style-src-elem` (nonce-protected) and `style-src-attr` (inline attributes)
- **Dashboard XSS** — API integers coerced with `parseInt` and inserted via `textContent`

### Security — Medium
- **TOTP Replay Prevention** — In-memory tracking of used TOTP codes per route (90s expiry)
- **Session Secure Warning** — Startup warning when production mode without HTTPS
- **Rate-Limiter Bypass** — Elevated limit only for session-authenticated requests
- **Backup Key Validation** — Regex allowlist for settings keys during restore
- **IP Filter Fix** — Uses Express-resolved `req.ip` instead of raw X-Forwarded-For header
- **CSS Injection** — Peer group color validated against hex regex
- **Monitoring XSS** — Response time sanitized with `parseInt` before HTML insertion
- **API Key Masking** — ip2location key no longer exposed in DOM, shows "Key is set" instead
- **Health Endpoint** — Detailed component state only for localhost, external gets `{ok: true/false}`
- **WG Signal Handling** — Guard variable prevents premature `wg-quick down` during startup

### Security — Low/Info
- Rate-limit error strings translated (EN+DE)
- Hardcoded German strings in routes.njk replaced with i18n
- Dead code `generateCsrfToken`/`verifyCsrfToken` removed
- Argon2 parallelism reduced from 4 to 1 (libuv thread pool)
- CSP `frame-ancestors: 'self'` added (clickjacking protection)
- Crypto ciphertext split with explicit length validation
- Branding fields capped at 255 (title) / 2000 (text) characters

### Documentation

- `documentation/SECURITY-CHANGES-v1.5.md` — Detailed migration guide for breaking changes (#13, #14, Prometheus config, Header-Auth)

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-23

### New Features
- **Request Mirroring** — Duplicate HTTP requests asynchronously to up to 5 secondary backends for testing, debugging, or shadow deployments. Implemented as a custom Caddy Go module (`http.handlers.mirror`) with async goroutines, `sync.Pool` body buffering (max 10 MB), and 10s per-target timeout. Mirror targets receive an exact copy (method, URI, headers, body). Client response is never affected. WebSocket upgrades are automatically skipped. Configurable via UI toggle + target editor or API.

### Improvements
- Docker: Custom `caddy-mirror` Go module added to Caddy build via xcaddy
- `.dockerignore` excludes `*.tar.gz` to reduce build context size
- Activity log: `route_mirror_changed` event for mirror configuration audit trail
- Server-side validation for mirror targets (IP, port, max 5, no primary-backend overlap, HTTP-only)

### UI
- Mirror toggle + target editor in route create form and edit modal
- Blue `Mirror: N targets` badge on route cards
- Mobile FAB speed-dial with Peer/Route add options
- Settings tab bar: no vertical scroll, no rounded corners, active tab with bottom border
- Settings tabs collapse to hamburger menu on mobile (≤900px)
- Route badges on mobile: horizontal scroll instead of stacking

### i18n
- 8 new mirror-related translation keys (EN + DE)

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-23

- **Automatic Backups** — Scheduled backups (6h/12h/daily/3d/weekly) with retention limit. Run-now button, file list with download/delete in Settings
- **Log Export** — Download activity and access logs as CSV or JSON with filter support

### New Features — Advanced Routing

- **Retry with Backoff** — Automatic retries on backend failure via Caddy `load_balancing.retries`
- **Multiple Backends / Load Balancing** — Weighted round-robin across multiple backend targets per route
- **Sticky Sessions** — Cookie-based session affinity for multi-backend routes

### New Features — Observability & Management
- **Prometheus Metrics Export** — `/metrics` endpoint with 12 gauges (peers, routes, CPU, RAM, uptime, per-peer traffic, per-route monitoring). Token + query-param auth. Toggle in Settings
- **Circuit Breaker** — Per-route circuit breaker (closed/open/half-open). Returns 503 via Caddy when backends fail repeatedly. Auto-recovery via monitoring checks
- **Batch Operations** — Multi-select peers and routes for bulk enable/disable/delete with floating action bar
- **Peer Groups** — Organize peers by team/location with colored badges, filter dropdown, group management card. Backup v3

### Testing
- **API test script** expanded to 231 tests across 31 sections covering all features
- Tests cover: health, auth, dashboard, peers CRUD, routes CRUD, route auth, settings, SMTP, logs, WireGuard, Caddy, system, webhooks, tokens, backup, peer expiry, ACL, auto-backup, log export, compression, custom headers, rate limiting, retry, backends, sticky sessions, Prometheus, circuit breaker, batch operations, peer groups, error handling, security

### Improvements
